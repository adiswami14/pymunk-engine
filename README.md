# pymunk-engine
An intro into the pymunk system, creating a basic physics engine which can help my understanding of this extensive library.


All this project does is spawn circles and shapes into a Pymunk space, and just interacts as a set of rigid bodies. While the project itself may not be much, it serves as a useful introduction into the Pymunk library, and the power of its usage.
